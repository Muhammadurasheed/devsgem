Welcome to the era of Gemini 3.
Google DeepMind is thrilled to invite you to the Gemini 3 global hackathon. We are pushing the boundaries of what AI can do by enhancing reasoning capabilities, unlocking multimodal experiences and reducing latency. Now, we want to see what you can create with our most capable and intelligent model family to date.

Whether you are a seasoned AI engineer or writing your first line of code, this is your invitation to build the future. We are looking for more than just another chat interface. We want to see fun, creative, next-generation applications built with the Gemini 3 family

Why participate?
Be First: Get hands-on access to the Gemini 3 API before the rest of the world catches up.

Build Something New: This challenge is strictly for new applications. It’s a level playing field for everyone.

Win Big: We have a prize pool of $100,000 + interviews with the AI Futures Fund team for an opportunity to fund your project.

Requirements
What to Build
The prompt is simple: Build a NEW application using the Gemini 3 API. There are no category restrictions. Build a game, a productivity tool, a scientific analyzer, or a robotic controller. If it uses Gemini 3 to do something cool, we want to see it! For inspiration, check out the Resources tab!

What to Submit

Text description describing the Gemini Integration - A brief write-up (~200 words) detailing which Gemini 3 features were used and how they are central to the application.
Public Project Link: A URL to your working product or interactive demo. Consider using AI Studio apps, which are the fastest way to build prototypes using the Gemini API. 
This allows judges to experience your project firsthand, if applicable. It should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall.
URL to your PUBLIC code repository - required if you do not have an AI Studio link to your project
~3-minute demonstration video - judges may not watch beyond 3 minutes
See full rules for details.

Gemini 3

Vibe Coding in AI Studio

 
Inspiration: 
Need a spark? Start here. Gemini 3 isn’t just a chatbot—it’s a multimodal reasoning engine. It can see, hear, and understand the world in real-time. Don't just build a text interface; build something that senses and reacts.

The launch of Gemini 3 signals the start of the Action Era, transitioning from static chat to autonomous agents that plan and execute complex, long-running tasks. This global hackathon, hosted by Google DeepMind and Devpost challenges you to build high-fidelity AI-powered applications using the Gemini API.

 

We strongly discourage the following types of projects: 

In the Action Era, if a single prompt can solve it, it is not an application. We are looking for orchestrators building robust systems using the Gemini API in Google AI Studio.


Baseline RAG: Gemini 3 Pro features a verified 1M token context window. It natively reasons over entire codebases and document sets; simple data retrieval is now a baseline feature.
Prompt Only Wrappers: Applications that are merely system prompts in a basic UI.
Simple Vision Analyzers: Basic object identification is obsolete. We want to see spatial-temporal video understanding that recognizes cause and effect.
Generic Chatbots: Standard bots for nutrition, job screening, or personality analysis.
Medical Advice: No projects generating medical or mental health diagnostic advice.
 

Strategic Tracks:
These tracks focus on market potential and technical depth. We encourage you to innovate beyond these prompts to showcase the full potential of Gemini 3 Pro.

🧠 The Marathon Agent: Build autonomous systems for tasks spanning hours or days. Use Thought Signatures and Thinking Levels to maintain continuity and self-correct across multi-step tool calls without human supervision.

☯️ Vibe Engineering: Leverage the Google AI Studio Build tab and Google Antigravity. Build agents that do not just write code but verify it through autonomous testing loops and browser-based verification artifacts.

👨‍🏫 The Real-Time Teacher: Use the Gemini Live API to synthesize live video and audio for adaptive learning.

🎨 Creative Autopilot: Combine Gemini 3 reasoning with Nano Banana Pro for high-precision multimodal creation. Use higher resolution and localized Paint-to-Edit controls to generate professional, brand-consistent assets with legible text
